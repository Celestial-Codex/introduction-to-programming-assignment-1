/* QUESTION:
 *
 * A program is required for a computer game. The user keys in the number of
 * rounds he wishes to play. For each round the user enters his lucky number.
 * The program takes the number and divides it with a secret number. If the
 * remainder of the division is zero, it is considered a draw for the round and
 * the total score is incriminated by 1. Otherwise if it is any other even
 * number, it is any other even number, it is considered a win for the round and
 * the total score is incremented by 3. However, if it is an odd number, it is
 * considered a loss for the round and the total score is decremented by 3. This
 * is done until he completes his rounds. He wins if the total at score at the
 * end is a positive number. Write a C program to accomplish this.
 *
